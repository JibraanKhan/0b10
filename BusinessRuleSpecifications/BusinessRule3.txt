ACTION TAKEN

Implementing the restrict deletion rule by checking if there are any costumes in the inventory that are using the costume_type that is
going to be deleted, if so then we do not delete that costume_type. Otherwise, we can delete the costume_type as that costume_type does
not have any records pertaining to it.
